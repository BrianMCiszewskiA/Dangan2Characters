He's very condescending when he talks about taking care of us, but he doesn't seem like a bad person.","Even without my memories, he says I'm still me. He asked me to be his assistant because of my potential. He used to be powerless, but not anymore. What does all this mean...?", "If something is always there for you, like fast food, it makes you feel safe. Because I take that consistency for granted, he says I'm much more fortunate than he is", "He was once weak, but he rose to the top by fighting his way through the Togami family's 'special hereditary system'. Still, the way he talks about it seems strange to me...", "He had to survive by becoming someone else because his own life had no meaning. He wants to tell me something when this is all over, so he can finally live as himself."]
